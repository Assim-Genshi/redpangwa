      "content": "Chapter 1\n\nRain whipped against the cliffside as Clara approached the lighthouse. It had been abandoned for years, but tonight, a dim light flickered in its tower.\n\nShe pushed open the rusted gate and stepped into the wind. Each gust whispered warnings, but curiosity pulled her forward. Her boots sank into the wet grass as thunder rolled over the sea.\n\nChapter 2\n\nInside, dust danced in the lantern glow. The air smelled of salt and secrets. Clara traced her fingers over old maps and brittle books. In the corner, a journal lay open — ink still fresh.\n\n\"If someone finds this, know that I didn’t vanish. I was taken. The light is a signal...\"\n\nChapter 3\n\nSuddenly, footsteps echoed from the stairs. Clara froze. A tall figure emerged from the shadows — a stranger, soaked in rain, eyes wide with fear.\n\n\"You saw the light too,\" he said. \"It called us both.\"\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe storm roared outside as the two strangers pieced together the journal’s clues. Names, dates, coordinates — all led to one truth: the lighthouse had been used for more than just guiding ships.\n\nIt had been a prison.\n\nChapter 5\n\nAt dawn, the storm broke. Clara and the stranger stood at the edge of the cliff, the journal in hand. Below, the sea calmed, revealing the dark outline of a sunken structure.\n\n\"This isn't the end,\" she said. \"It’s the beginning.\"\n\nThe wind whispered once more, and the lighthouse light went dark."
